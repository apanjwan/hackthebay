hack the bay prototype for CMC

Challenge

CMC would like to develop a case study of an area with sufficient historic/time series data and investigate if and how water quality has changed over time, including other native Bay species (submerged aquatic vegetation) has changed, and what environmental factors/practices may have influenced those changes.

Questions we are trying to answer:

- How has water quality changed over time? 
- Specifically how do water quality trends differ over time in land use, to development data, geology, or impervious surface cover?
- How have environmental factors/practices affected change in water quality or other native Bay species?
- How can we incorporate independent research or additional data to develop a story or model around how developments or changes in practices may have impacted water quality?
- How do analyses using the Data Explorer data (alone, or in conjunction with other water quality data) differ from existing analyses?
- What barriers/challenges exist for pairing Data Explorer data and external datasets for this analysis?

What defines water quality?

- Use one of the following water quality metrics to study: 

  1) temperature and pH in Virginia; 
  2) conductivity in Pennsylvania;
  3) benthic (EPT) presence/absence in Virginia/Maryland) - How is this defined?
